# Product Ranking Website

This is the project of COMP3019J Team29, 
which is called the "**Product Ranking Website**".

## Description of the project -- Intended Functionality: 

The website only distinguishes between logged-in users and none-logged-in users.  

The website shows ranking lists of different categories of products and their detailed information and the corresponding feedbacks about them form other users. 

The website allows logged-in users to upload products with detailed information (name, description, price, image) that they want to sell on the website.  

The website allows logged-in users to view the products they have already uploaded to the website.

The website allows logged-in users to search keywords about products that they are looking for.  

The website allows logged-in users to buy products that have been already uploaded by other logged-in users. 

The website allows logged-in users to leave feedback, both in terms of number of stars and in terms of textual comments about products that they have already bought.

The website only allows None-logged-in users to browse the ranking lists and the top-5 positive comments, and lowest-5 negative comments about the products.
